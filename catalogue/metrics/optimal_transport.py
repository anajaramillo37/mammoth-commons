    """Creates an optimal transport evaluation based on the implementation provided by the AIF360 library.
    The evaluation computes the Wasserstein distance that reflects the cost of transforming the predictive
    distributions between sensitive attribute groups.

    <p>Optimal Transport (OT) is a field of mathematics which studies the geometry of probability spaces. Among its
    many contributions, OT provides a principled way to compare and align probability distributions by taking into
    account the underlying geometry of the considered metric space.
    As a mathematical problem, it was first introduced by Gaspard Monge in 1781. It addresses the task of determining
    the most efficient method for transporting mass from one distribution to another. In this problem, the cost
    associated with moving a unit of mass from one position to another is referred to as the ground cost. The primary
    objective of OT is to minimize the total cost incurred when moving one mass distribution onto another.
    </p><p>
    OT can be used to detect model-induced bias by calculating the a cost known as Earth Mover's distance or
    Wasserstein distance between the distribution of ground truth labels and model predictions for each of the
    protected groups. If its value is close to 1, the model is biased towards this group.
